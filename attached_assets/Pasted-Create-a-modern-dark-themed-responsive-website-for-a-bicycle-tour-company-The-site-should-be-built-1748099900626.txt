Create a modern, dark-themed responsive website for a bicycle tour company. The site should be built using HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS preferred), and JavaScript (or React if component-based). It must include the following features and structure:

🌑 Theme & General Design:

Use a clean and modern dark mode design.
TailwindCSS (or equivalent) for consistent mobile-first responsive layout.
Smooth transitions, large readable fonts, soft shadows, and rounded corners.
A small floating WhatsApp icon visible on every page, fixed to the bottom-right corner, which opens a predefined WhatsApp chat link.
🏠 Homepage (/):

Full-width YouTube video header at the top (autoplay, muted, looped, embedded responsively).
Below the video: A short intro about the bicycle tour company and what makes it special.
Call-to-action button: “Book a Tour” → leads to the reservation page or scrolls to reservation section.
📍 Routes Page (/routes):

Display a list or grid of bicycle tour routes, each with:
Route name
Difficulty level
Distance/duration
Description
Map preview (image or Google Maps iframe)
“Select This Route” or “Learn More” button
📬 Contact Page (/contact):

Simple contact form: Name, email, subject, message.
Contact details: address, email (clickable), phone.
Embedded Google Map of the office.
Reminder message: “Need help? Chat with us directly on WhatsApp!”
📅 Reservation Page (/reservation):

A complete form for booking a bicycle tour, including:

Full Name
Email
Phone Number
Select Route (dropdown populated from routes page data)
Date of Tour
Participants Count
Tour Type:
Radio buttons or toggle: Group Tour / Private (Solo)
Additional Notes
Submit button with validation.
After submission, display a confirmation message or redirect to a thank-you page.
Include basic error handling (e.g., missing required fields).
⚙️ Optional Enhancements:

Add smooth scrolling and fade-in animations.
Lazy load the YouTube video and images for performance.
Include SEO-friendly meta tags and Open Graph support.
Ready to deploy to platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
Tech stack: HTML + TailwindCSS + vanilla JS or React (no TypeScript). No Swiper. Fully responsive. Prioritize mobile UX.
